**ASSESMENT FEEDBACK SYSTEM**

Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on learning and achievement. It is conceptualised as information provided by lecturers regarding aspects of student’s performance or understanding of a learning subject and Lecturer. Feedback thus is a “consequence” of performance empowering student learning in the next stage. In many cases, various Lecturer types are designed to evaluate students’ performance and understanding of the learning subject. Often, feedback is lacking and ineffective to be provided to students except the grade as result, after the assessments process is completed. As such, you are commissioned to develop an Assessment Feedback System (AFS) that supports the lecturers to assess students’ work such as assignments, class tests evaluations and etc whichever relevant at Asia Pacific University (A.P.U). In this system, it can create and manage feedback according to the subject assessments, deliver it to students timely, classify the grading based on pre-defined marks allocation and produce feedback reports.





**There are 4 types of end users interacting to the AFS:**

1. Administrative staff

2. Academic leaders

3. Lecturers 

4. Students

**The application should have the following features:**

1) Login access

2) User registration

3) Grading system

4) Create new classes

5) Create new modules

6) Design Lecturer types

7) Key in Lecturer results

8) Provide feedback

9) Analysed Report 





In addition, a supporting document is needed to reflect the design of the implementation codes and the implementation details that utilize the Object-oriented programming concepts.
